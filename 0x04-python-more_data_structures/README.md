search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element

You are not allowed to import any module

6. Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type

7. Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

Prototype: def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):
key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created
You are not allowed to import any module

8. Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

Prototype: def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):
key argument will be always a string
If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
